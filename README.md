# Next Word Prediction

This project introduces you to the fascinating world of Natural Language Processing (NLP) by training a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) using TensorFlow and Keras to predict the next word in a given sentence or text. By exploring this project, you will learn how to harness the power of deep learning to generate contextually relevant text predictions.

# Overview
Next Word Prediction is a fundamental NLP task used in various applications like chatbots, autocomplete suggestions, and text generation. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are well-suited for sequential data and excel at capturing context, making them an excellent choice for this task.

# In this project, we will:

1. Collect and preprocess a text dataset for training.
2. Build an RNN model using TensorFlow and Keras that understands the context of words in a sentence.
3. Train the model on the dataset, teaching it to predict the next word based on the input sequence.
4. Evaluate the model's performance in generating coherent and contextually relevant predictions.
5. Deploy the trained model for real-time next word prediction.

# Prerequisites
To run this project, you will need the following:
1. TensorFlow and Keras (for deep learning)
2. A suitable text dataset for training (e.g., a collection of sentences or paragraphs).

# Results
Upon completing this project, you will have a working Next Word Prediction model that can generate contextually relevant text predictions. You can further fine-tune the model with larger datasets and explore more advanced NLP techniques to enhance its performance.
